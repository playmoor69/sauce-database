# sauce-database

This is the Sauce database. If you're a degenerate weeb like me, this is for you. Running this script will give you a random Sauce. 

Examples: (In computer terminal)

Windows: python "F:\Python 3 code\Sauce Database.py"
MacOs: python /Users/Michael/Documents/python/Sauce Database.py
Linux: 1. cd /usr/bin/python 
       2. chmod +x Sauce Database.py 
       3. ./Sauce Database.py
       
Also, you can open the file in IDLE to add your own Sauce or remove some that's already in there. Additionally, you can run the script with IDLE instead. 
I want to keep updating this and add more Sauce to make this evene a bigger database.
